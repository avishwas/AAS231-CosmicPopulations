# AAS231-CosmicPopulations

This repo will contain content for a workshop on on hierarchical modeling of cosmic populations proposed for the [AAS 231 meeting](https://aas.org/meetings/aas231) to be held in January 2018, in Washington, DC.  Planned topics include:

* Quick intro to Bayesian inference
* Hierarchical Bayes for estimating distributions and correlations with noisy data
* Handling selection effects with thinned latent point process models
* Posterior sampling and MCMC
* Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)

The workshop will include hands-on demonstrations using Python (in Jupyter notebooks), R, and [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) via its [PyStan](http://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/pystan.html) Python interface.  The presenters will be [Tom Loredo (Cornell astronomer)](http://www.astro.cornell.edu/staff/loredo/) and [Jessi Cisewski (Yale statistician)](http://statistics.yale.edu/people/jessi-cisewski).

More detailed content will appear if/when the workshop proposal is accepted.
